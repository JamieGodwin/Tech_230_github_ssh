# AMI
## What is an AMI
- AMI stands for amazon machne image.
- The AMI takes a snapshot of the instance you are running. The exact state will be copies, so if it's up and running, it will be running if you also launch the copy.
- It also allows you to launch multiple copies of the same instance at the same time. 

## Creating an AMI

- We can provision the instance by slecting "advanced details" while creating the instance.
- The provision can then be added to the "user settings".
